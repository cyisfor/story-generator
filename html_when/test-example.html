<when censored>This must be safe for the censor.<else/>This can be whatever the fuck you want.</when>

<when !censored>If you just want to omit something the assholes would censor, you can do that too.</when>

<when not censored>This syntax isn’t especially smart, so don’t get fancy with it.</when>

<when !notcensored not>What did I fucking say?</when>

<when not !censored>Still pretty stupid.</when>

<when not="1" stupid="1">XML sucks, by the way. Don’t assign values just to make attributes exist.</when>

The environment variable “foo” <when foo>has<else/>has not</when> been set.

Checks based on environment variables at runtime, so you don’t get situations where it’s half censored, half not. &lt;when&gt; must have one or two attributes. If two, one attribute must be “not” which negates the condition. If the other attribute starts with ! that also negates the condition.
